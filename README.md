# Simple Banking System
Simple Bank System
This is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) based Simple Bank System built using Python and Tkinter. This application allows users to create a bank account, deposit and withdraw funds, and view their balance. Itâ€™s designed as a simple banking interface to demonstrate basic banking operations in a GUI environment.

Features
Account Registration: Users can register a new bank account by entering their account number, username, and initial deposit.
View Balance: Users can view their current account balance.
Deposit Money: Users can deposit money into their account.
Withdraw Money: Users can withdraw money from their account, provided they have sufficient balance.
Real-time Feedback: The app provides real-time feedback on successful transactions and error messages for invalid actions.
Installation
To run this project, make sure you have Python installed on your system. Tkinter comes pre-installed with Python, so no additional installations are required.

Clone the repository or download the code files.

Open a terminal or command prompt in the project folder.

Run the following command to start the application:

bash
Copy code
python bank_system.py
Code Structure

Future Improvements
Database Integration: Currently, the account information is stored in a dictionary, which resets when the app closes. Integrating a database would allow persistent storage of account data.
Login Authentication: Adding user authentication (such as passwords) would improve security for account access.
Error Handling: Enhanced error handling for cases like invalid input types and edge cases.
Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language.
Tkinter: Used for creating the GUI elements.
